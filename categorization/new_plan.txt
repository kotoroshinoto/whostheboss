minimum viable project is to assign classification from that dataset
our dataset has no subset of pre-labeled data according to the desired bins

However we can use canadian gov't labels to get started. Once the NLP system is functioning we can

I will try to provide for generating appropriate bags of words for this purpose if I have the time to
program it, but I will also write out my thoughts on the matter in the event that further code development
is required for that purpose.
